title: "Facts About Me"
description: | 
  I was a historical reenactor for a summer, and I played the role of Martha Washington. 
  
  I'm an avid runner. I made my own half marathon event this past year: The Baltimore Blueberry Half Marathon. 
  
  I have a cat named George, and I'm his third (and hopefully final) owner.
