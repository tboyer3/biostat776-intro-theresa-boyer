  I’m a second-year MSPH student in the Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health. I’m also completing the final course for my MS in Biotechnology with a concentration in bioinformatics this term. 
  
  I graduated from Brown University with a double major in art history and gender studies. I wrote my senior thesis about how 17th century Dutch dollhouses acted as a performative tool for women to express the realities of childbirth and domesticity during that time period. While I’ll never turn down going to a museum, I soon realized the limitations of considering all problems from a historical perspective. As a result, I worked as a clinical research coordinator in the Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine at both the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University prior to starting my graduate work. I always enjoyed the opportunity to take courses a night, and my courses in cell and molecular biology opened up many new ways to investigate maternal and child health issues.
